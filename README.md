Bespoke Links to Instruments for Surface and Space (BLISS) GUI
==============================================================

BLISS GUI provides a framework for building a custom website for realtime telemetry monitoring, commanding, and other MOS operations with only minimal HTML and configuration file changes. Built on top of the BLISS Core libraries, BLISS GUI provides web-development friendly access to the underlying telemetry, commanding, EVR, system logging, and other BLISS Core functions in addition to a suite of pre-built UI Components and a REST API to handle common MOS use cases.
